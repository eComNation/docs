# 1. The Anatomy of a Theme 
Every 39shops theme consist of certain basic elements which work together to
show up the online store. These elements are:
• Templates
• Page Parts
• Stylesheets
• JavaScript
• Images

## 1.1. Templates
Templates are specialized HTML pages with *.liquid extension to parse dynamic
tags supported by 39shops. 39shops provides a set of standard templates
based on the functions each of them perform. Here are the templates provided
with every 39shops theme:
• layout
• home
• catalogue
• product detail
• page
• cart

### 1.1.1. Layout
The layout holds the most common elements of the website. It behaves like a
standard template which gets applied to each page of your online store. Layout
consists of common elements of your design such as - page background,
header and footer, or any other element that will stay consistently visible across
all the pages of your online store. Elements once included into the Layout
template will not be required to be included in any other template. Such
elements will be automatically displayed across all pages of your online store.

### 1.1.2 Home
Customize your home page using this template. Anything that you want to
display specifically on your home page can be included in this template. You can
include elements such as Images, JavaScript, featured products, featured
categories etc.

### 1.1.3. Catalogue
You can customize your product catalogue using this template. It includes your
products and categories list, featured products, featured categories, pagination
as well as any additional elements such as side navigation etc.

### 1.1.4. Product detail
Using this template you can customize the design of product detail page. This
page will be accessible to site visitors when they click on a product to view more
details. This page will display dynamic data such as product title, product
description, alternate photos, produce price etc.

### 1.1.5. Page
Using this template you can customize the design of CMS based pages also
called ‘custom pages’. It is used to display all the content pages that you added
from the ‘Pages’ section of your store administration.

### 1.1.6. Cart
Using this template you can customize the design of your shopping cart page. 


## 1.2. Page Parts
Pages parts are small HTML elements or snippets that can be included in any
Template. Page parts are very useful if you want to display common elements in
certain areas of your online store. For example, if you want to include a common
promotional banner in all pages, you will create it a page part. Then you will
simply insert the page part in all templates pages. In this way, if you need to
change the promotional banner, you will only need to modify the page part.


## 1.3. Stylesheets
Just like any other website, you can attach Stylesheet to your templates. In your
39shops theme, Stylesheets are linked with the ‘Layout’ template.


## 1.4. JavaScript
JavaScript can be also included in the same way as Stylesheets with the ‘Layout’
template of your theme. 39Shops themes support all types of JavaScript
including Jquery.

## 1.5. Images
A default images folder is provided with every 39shops theme. It stores all types
of graphics such as background images, bullets, icons, banners etc. associated
with your theme.

Note: The Images folder associated with your theme not store product photos or any files
related to the content of your online store. Such files are stored in the ‘File Manager’.
